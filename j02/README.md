# Cosori Air Fryer
By: Madison Fong, 04/15/2022

Retailing at $99.99, the Cosori Pro LE 5.0-Quart Air Fryer is a sleek take on the common airfryer. Featuring digital buttons, temperature gauge, and timer on the top as
well as a singular button to open the oven drawer, this device appears simple to use to create an **efficient** cooking tool for the user.

The power button located at the bottom left of the display indicates whether the air fryer is powered on or not through the use of color. It is blue while powered off and
white when on. Upon turning on the device the rest of the display will light up as well.

There is a row of preset buttons for various foods at the top which makes it fast and easy for the user if they want to cook something from those options. Otherwise there
are temperature and time controls surrounding the display. The row of buttons next to the power are settings that the user can select. Preheat will preheat the oven before
food goes in, Keep Warm will keep whatever is currently in the basket warm, Shake turns on or off the "shake" notification when the timer is halfway done, and finally there
is a play and pause button to start or pause cooking. 

This display seems simple to learn. However, there are different designs of air fryers out there. Due to me owning a different brand I find it difficult to use the controls.
I am accustomed to the device always being on and being able to just pop my food in and press start. For me, the power button is inconvienent and not **effective** as when
I am trying to use the device, I expect it to be on. I also find the controls for time and temperature to be inconvienent as it is hard to continuously press a button to
increase or decrease the desired object. I find the knobs on my airfryer to be much more gentle on my hands and quicker when finding the desired numbers. However, these
issues could just be due to the lack of practice using the device.

While it takes a little while to adjust to the controls, the device is capable of its intended use. Food is able to be cooked quickly inside no matter the settings chosen.
