Bought in 2018 as a graduation present, the 2018 Subaru Impreza hatchback in the Limited model features a large touch screen with actual buttons underneath, as well as a CD player and the general controls for car functions as well. Due to all the buttons being clearly labeled, the control panel is highly **memorable** which is incredibly important in car design.

Upon starting the car the user is greeted with the screen and buttons lighting up. Due to the outline surrounding the icons on the display, the I am able to immediately tell that I can interact with them and that they will take me to the applications corresponding to the images. The app design is also reminiscent of the app designs used on most smart devices making the actions extremely **learnable**.

The buttons underneath the display are also extremely learnable and **effective**. Due to the bright labels and their commonality in cars, one is able to quickly navigate through those buttons and remember their uses. One button that takes a little getting used to is the "Media" button which shows any device playing music whether it is through bluetooth or usb/aux. However, after practice this becomes much easier to remember.

Underneath the media buttons, there is the section with the temperature and fan control buttons, as well as the hazards. The hazards are bright and have a good contrast to the surrounding area, making it easy to spot and find when needed. The buttons are also clearly labeled as well with symbols that one should know if they are operating a vehicle. The center of the two big knobs on the sides are actually two buttons, one on the top and one on the bottom. For the temperature control, this sometimes gets confusing as there is only an light indicator on the "auto" button, which sometimes makes me forget that I can use the bottom button to actually turn off the air. These bottom knobs are also sometimes finicky, as when one turns too fast, the knob doesn't register how much in one direction it has gone, making the total higher or lower than the user was trying to get.

Overall, the control display for my car is super easy to use. I am able to do things quickly and efficiently which is very important when it comes to trying to change settings while driving. Due to the extremely memorable design, it is also easy for my parents to be able to use the controls when driving my car.
