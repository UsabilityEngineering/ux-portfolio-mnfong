# The Nordstorm App

  Nordstrom is a major department store so it is only fitting that their app reflects its status. Upon opening the app the user is greeted with a search bar at the very top, buttons to select departments, and a revolving banner that showcases new promotions. This makes the app extremely **learnable** as the location of these items don't change and they are easily accessible.

  Due to the app's design being a very familiar one, it is very **error tolerant**. It allows the user to already be familiar with the layout and with the labels on each button, it would be hard for the user to make a mistake, especially without being able to reverse it. One thing that is not intuitive though is the department buttons at the top. At first glance it is hard to tell that they are able to be scrolled, revealing other buttons behind the last one on the screen. This may confuse users if they do not automatically see what they want and may make them frustrated if they continue to miss it.

  Another thing that can be improved on is removing items from one's wishlist. Instead of having a button to directly remove items or an option on the items, one must pick "select" then go through and pick items that they either wish to add to their bag, move, or delete. This is especially confusing when one considers that the "add to bag" feature is repeated. This lacks **efficiency** as there is several extra steps for the consumer and makes the app more difficult to navigate at this stage.
  
  Despite those minor flaws, Nordstrom has one of the best shopping apps that I've used. When the user is able to figure out where everything is, it becomes very easy and efficient to search or browse for items.
